# AI Web Crawler

This is a Python-based AI Web Crawler that crawls websites and collects data. It uses advanced algorithms and techniques to navigate web pages and extract valuable information, which can be used for various purposes such as data mining, SEO analysis, or gathering data for machine learning models.

## Features
- **Crawling**: It can crawl through multiple web pages recursively.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts useful information like text, links, images, etc.
- **AI Integration**: It leverages machine learning to analyze and process the data it collects.
- **Configurable**: You can configure which data to scrape, from which websites, and how deep to crawl.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for making HTTP requests)
- `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` (for web scraping)
- Any additional dependencies can be added to the `requirements.txt`
